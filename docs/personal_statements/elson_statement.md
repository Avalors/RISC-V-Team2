## Summary of Contributions
I was responsible for `alu.sv`, 'controlunit.sv`, `registerfile.sv`, and `mux.sv` and their respective testbenches for Lab 4.

### Lab 4

## What I learned
- Using learning materials correctly: "Digital Design and Computer Architecture", online courses, videos, lecture slides
- Working as a team, planning work in advance
- Gained technical skills whilst integrating the different modules, writing testbenches for each of them, debugging each module
- Learnt to use Git and Linux
- Understanding the RISCV microarchitecture and pseudoinstructions


## Mistakes I made
- Syntax errors (forgetting newlines)
- Took some time for me to learn the importance of teamwork and helping one another
- Debugging the testbenches took quite some time to truly understand as well as the new `doit.sh` script from Lab 4 

## What I would do differently
- Collaborate more as a team to deubgging the testbenches
- Set goals in advance
