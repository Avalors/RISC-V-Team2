## What I learned
- Using learning materials correctly: "Digital Design and Computer Architecture", online courses, videos, lecture slides...
- Working as a team, planning work in advance
- Gained technical skills whilst integrating the different modules, writing testbenches for each of them, debugging each module...
- Learnt to use Git and Linux


## Mistakes I made
- Syntax errors (forgetting newlines, getting the number of bits wrong...)
- Took some time for me to learn the importance of teamwork and helping one another 

## What I would do differently
- Do background research before the project
- Set goals in advance
