## Introduction

`Lab 4` allowed us to create a very simplified CPU able to implement a few basic instructions, while building on what we had done in labs 1-3. 
We got to understand the different levels of abstraction in a computer and how a CPU fits within one.

It made us get a taste for how the different units within the CPU interact, what their purpose is, and how to test or integrate them together. 
It also gave us the opportunity to organise ourselves as a team, use Github and Markdown, try different operating systems (ie. Linux) and keep track of our progress using logbooks (via Obsidian). 

`Lab 4` also made us practice our SystemVerilog skills, as well as our debugging skills via GTKwave and running Vbuddy.

## Design Specifications

Design Principles of a RISC-V architecture:
  - Simplicity favours regularity
  - Make the common case fast
  - Smaller is faster
