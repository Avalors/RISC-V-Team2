## Introduction

Once 'lab4' was implemented, our next challenge was to implement Single-cycle. We created a separate branch for this and added a data memory and a PDF testbench. 
We also had to edit several modules to account for the new changes, and tested our code using GTKwave, Verilator and the PDF, as well as Vbuddy (for f1_lights).
The control unit module, as well as the top module, required many amendments.

## Design Specifications

We used 20 bits for the data memory, meaning we had 2^20 memory addresses.

![Data memory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fff3502b-2b55-4ce8-9b49-9290fa49449c)

We added the AddrMode signal in order to efficiently implement byte addressing for 'lb' and 'sb' instructions. 

Here is how we initialised our data memory:

![Initialisation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/345b3dad-c85a-4342-9f1a-28cc72ed0b15)

We can see the 3-bit AddrMode signal, and we can also see that ADDR_REAL_WIDTH is set to 20. We also opted for little-endian storage, meaning computer operations could be faster and simpler.

Below, we can see the code section which reads the data.hex file found in the rtl folder:

Here is the code for load and store instructions:

Our logic was to associate 3-bit codes with a certain instruction, which we were able to test using the following assembly file:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f9d2fbe-04b3-4f94-8f1a-a88ce55be975)

We spent a lot of time editing the control unit, specifically dealing with the RET and JALR instructions. 

We struggled to run the PDF test: when using GTKwave, we realised the RET instruction wasn't working. By analysing the machine code, we realised it's a version of the JALR instruction, which we hadn't implemented yet. By adding additional control signals (we added an additional bit to PCSrc to allow feedback from the result signal to the program counter input MUX) and we later realised that our B and J type instructions were not storing return addresses in the register file. We resolved this by adding a MUX to the WD3 input which, using a WD3Src control signal, we enabled PC + 4 to be stored in the register file for our B and J type instructions.

As shown above there is an additional implementation for the ret instructions under the JALR instruction, since ret is a special case of JALR. 

Here is an example of how we implemented these instructions case by case and according to the input signals.

We then used the testbench to verify the control unit was fully operational.

## Simulation and testing

The 'compile.sh' and 'doit.sh' scripts help compile and assemble C and ASM tests in the testbench. 

We tested our integrated single cycle processor using Vbuddy, by running 'f1_lights.s' but also by running the PDF on it for several signals: sine, triangle, noise, Gaussian.

## Full RV32I and assembly code

We used the asm code to verify that all the instructions were implemented correctly and we did the verification of the expected values directly on the assembly language.

TEST_F(InstrTestbench, RTypeTest)
{
    // Compile the assembly code r-type.s
    system("./compile.sh --input asm/01-R_type.s");
    
    runSimulation(1000);

    //value a0 = 150 is arbitrary value that I set to check all R-type instr
    //All checks are done in the asm code itself and this "special" value 150 only seen if all are passed
    EXPECT_EQ((int)top->a0, 150);
}
```

The way this was implemented was testing the individual instruction in assembly language and using `bne` to branch to `fail_test` if it was not equal to the expected value but it will `jump` to the next test if it is equal to the expected value.
